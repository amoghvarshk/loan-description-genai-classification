# Loan Description Classification with GenAI (Gemini)

This project uses Googleâ€™s Gemini LLM to classify LendingClub loan descriptions into categories and estimates time and cost to scale across a full dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- Labeled 100 loan descriptions into `business`, `home improvement`, or `other` using Gemini LLM.
- Validated LLM outputs against manually labeled descriptions to assess accuracy.
- Compared outputs at temperature settings 0, 1, and 2 to evaluate consistency.
- Estimated large-scale labeling cost ($4,370.89) and time (85 days on free tier vs. ~1 hour on Tier 1) for 126,053 loans.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Gemini API (via prompt engineering)
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
